    <p>My hybrid expression of movement is derived from the many dance
        influences in my life. I
        received my formal dance training at Ballet Hispanico in New York City. I graduated from Hunter College with
        a BA in Anthropology and Linguistics--a degree that infused me with wanderlust, a craving to learn more
        languages, and the desire to engage with different cultures in the way that to me comes most naturally: through
        dance. My travels allowed me the opportunity to study flamenco in Madrid, tango in Buenos Aires, and aerial
        arts in Brazil.

    </p>
    <p>
        A jill of all trades, when not dancing I am crafting, improvising, and finding art in whatever form, and forever
        learning. This website is an example of exactly that.
    </p>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
